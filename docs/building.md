# Building

This is how to build Free Riders Recompiled from source; players can use the
[releases](https://github.com/YuutaTsubasa/Free-Riders-Recompiled/releases)
instead. The game's code is C++ generated from the `default.xex` on **your
own** Sonic Free Riders disc. The disc's files and everything extracted from
them stay on your machine (`private/`, `game/` and `out/` are ignored by Git);
nothing in this repository contains game code or data. Making a release from
such a build is described in [releasing.md](releasing.md).

Supported disc: *Sonic Free Riders (USA, Europe) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)*. The
scripts check its `default.xex` fingerprint (`config/source.json`) and refuse
anything else.

## 1. Tools

| Platform | Needed |
| --- | --- |
| Windows (build and game-code generation) | Git, Python 3.12+, Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ desktop workload, LLVM/Clang (`C:\Program Files\LLVM`), CMake 3.20+, Ninja |
| Linux | Git, Python 3.11+, Clang 15+, CMake, Ninja, `libsdl2-dev`, `libx11-dev`, a Vulkan driver (`mesa-vulkan-drivers` works) |
| Android (built on Windows or Linux) | Everything above, plus the Android SDK (build-tools, platform 35), NDK 27+ and JDK 17 |

Fetch the pinned third-party sources (XenonRecomp, XenosRecomp with its
prebuilt DXC, Plume, Dear ImGui, SDL) into `tools/`:

```bash
python scripts/bootstrap.py
```

`config/dependencies.lock.json` records every revision. Bootstrap never
changes an existing checkout, and applies (and afterwards verifies) the small
Plume patch in `patches/`.

## 2. Build the tools

Windows (PowerShell, from the repository root):

```powershell
./scripts/build_tools.ps1
```

This builds XenonRecomp/XenonAnalyse, the image dumper, the launcher
(`out/build/host/FreeRidersRecompiled.exe`) and the runtime's tests
(`ctest --test-dir out/build/host`).

## 3. Generate the game code

Extract `default.xex` from your disc image, then generate the code:

```powershell
python scripts/rom_tool.py extract --iso "path/to/Sonic Free Riders (USA, Europe) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It).iso" --output private/game --path default.xex
python scripts/prepare_recomp.py
```

`prepare_recomp.py` decodes the executable, analyses its jump tables, runs
XenonRecomp and turns its output into the checked form the runtime builds
(`out/recomp/diagnostic`, about six minutes). It refuses to overwrite an
existing output; pass `--output DIR` for another one. The ISO and `private/`
stay on your machine (both are ignored by Git).

## 4. Build the game

### Windows

```powershell
./scripts/build_shader_translator.ps1
./scripts/build_tools.ps1 -Diagnostic
./out/build/host/FreeRidersRecompiled.exe
```

The launcher installs the game on first run: choose your disc image (or a
folder with its files); it copies the disc's files to `game/assets` beside the
launcher and decodes the executable to `game/image`. Then press **Start game**.
Settings are kept in `settings.ini`, saves in `save/`, the game's trace in
`game.log`, all beside the launcher.

The shader translator lets the game translate the Xbox shaders it meets while
running (Direct3D 12 by default, Vulkan in the launcher's Advanced tab).
`python scripts/pack_shaders.py` collects the shaders translated so far into
`out/shaders/shaders.pack` for machines without the translator (Linux,
Android).

### Linux

```bash
scripts/build_linux.sh --diagnostic out/recomp/diagnostic
~/sfr-build/FreeRidersRecompiled
```

The build directory defaults to `~/sfr-build` (`SFR_LINUX_BUILD` changes it).
The launcher is the same as on Windows; it uses zenity or kdialog for file
dialogs when installed. Linux has no shader translator yet, so copy a
`shaders.pack` made on Windows next to the launcher (the Game files tab can
copy one in). Game-code generation (step 3) has so far been run on Windows;
the generated directory can be copied to Linux. Details: [linux.md](linux.md).

### Android

```bash
scripts/build_android.sh --diagnostic out/recomp/diagnostic
```

This builds `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` with the NDK and packages
`out/android/FreeRidersRecompiled.apk` with the SDK's own tools (no Gradle, no
downloads). Install it, copy your disc image and a `shaders.pack` to the phone,
then install from the app's launcher. Hold Back to leave the game. Details and
limits: [android.md](android.md).

A machine without the NDK can still build the APK: the **android apk** workflow
does it on a GitHub runner, installing its own SDK, NDK, CMake and Ninja
([android-apk-workflow.md](android-apk-workflow.md)). It is handed the two
things only your machine can make — `out/recomp/diagnostic` and
`out/shaders/shaders.pack` — as one zip (`python scripts/package_sources.py`,
shared by a link) or in a private repository; the runner downloads and checks
them with `scripts/fetch_sources.py`. Your disc image is never involved.

## Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir out/build/host                              # Windows
xvfb-run -a ctest --test-dir ~/sfr-build                     # Linux (or with a display)
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Tests that need the game's files skip unless their environment variables point
at them (see `tests/`). The GitHub workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
builds and tests everything that does not need the game on Windows and Linux,
and the Android launcher libraries. It also checks that the runtime and
launcher build on macOS (Apple Silicon, Homebrew LLVM and SDL2); the game has
not been run on a Mac yet, and the tests that map guest memory are left out
there because they need 4 KiB host pages.
